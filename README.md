# ezDev-2.0
My own version of Skript.
Doubt this will ever reach a release, mainly for fun right now.

Some plans:
 - Define command arguments. Example usage:
    ```
    command kill <victim>:
        kill victim
        tell victim "You got killed!"
    end
    ```
 - Developer API
    - Add custom actions + events
